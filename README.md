Basic Emacs key bindings are supported for the following programs:

- Notepad
- FreeCommander XE
- Cmd and PowerShell
- P4V
- Firefox address bar
- Office Communicator / Skype
- MusicBee
- Visual Studio and R#
- PyCharm
- Outlook email editor
- Word dialogs (Emacs key bindings for Word are available through [VBacs](http://www.rath.ca/Misc/VBacs/)

It should be fairly straightforward to add support to other programs. Feel free to contribute.
